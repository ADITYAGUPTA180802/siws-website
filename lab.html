     	 <h3>Computer Lab</h3>
			<p>
			The college is endowed with six computer laboratories and an electronics laboratory to cater to the course practically.<br><br>

		The Computer Laboratories are well-equipped with hardware and software attaining to fulfil the courses requirement and deliver the course practically.<br><br>
		The Computers are suited up with Intel Core i5, 64 bit based processor, RAM of 8 Gigabyte, some with Hard disk drive of 512 Gigabyte and 1 Terabyte,<br> equipped with the latest Storage Solid State Drive of 256 Gigabyte and the required input and output devices.<br><br>
		The Computers are also connected in a network following peer-to-peer architecture, having an internet speed of 100 MbPS with supporting D-Link wireless routers and switches with<br> 16 ports with the required maximum speed.<br><br>
		The Computer Laboratories are provided with Printers and Uninterrupted Power Supply having backup facility of three hours.<br><br>
		The institute is assertive about the open source technology, so few computer laboratories are supported by the Linux Operating System with the latest version of Ubuntu and<br> to make aware the students with other platforms too; some laboratories are availed with Windows 10 operating system and the necessary<br> Application Software as per the curricula of the University of Mumbai.<br><br>
		The course of Information Technology and Computer Science is integrated with hardware and software; the Electronics lab too plays a crucial role.<br><br>
		The Electronics Laboratory is instrumental in making the students learn, understand and explore ranging from –<br><br>
		2 bit Boolean values gates (designing circuit and simulating the gates using breadboards, integrated circuits, resistors, wires and LEDs).<br><br>
		8 bit microprocessor to comprehend the assembly language.<br><br>
		16 bit microcontrollers to familiarize with Embedded Systems.<br><br>
		32 bit Raspberry Pi to study and evolve with the Internet of Things.<br><br>
		The Computer Laboratories are well maintained and managed by the Staffs of the Information Technology, Computer Science and Electronics departments.<br><br>
		Students are given access to computers with internet facility to execute projects, case-studies and practical between 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
